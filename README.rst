brennivin
=========

Brennivin is a series of utility libraries that were developed while
working on EVE Online, by CCP Games.
It includes all sorts of generally useful Python functionality
that is useful in almost any domain.
Rather than reinvent the wheel,
or look all over the place for the right screw driver,
Brennivin was created to have a single
well tested and documented place for utilities.

This is an Open Source fork of that internal code.
Less useful or Windows-specific portions have been stripped,
and may be added as companion packages in the future.

Anyway, there's no sort of framework here,
just cohesive modules that will save you some work.
Hopefully Brennivin has what you need.
